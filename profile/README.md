## Build things faster, more efficiently, and cost-effectively

In a nutshell, Conveyor is an open-source automation (CI) server for your projects and team, so machines handle the tasks that people hate doing. We provide support for well-known container orchestration systems like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), with many pre-built images available.

**Want to contribute?** Any contribution would be appreciated by us and the Conveyor community.
